## Medium/low priority ideas

[] Group monsters by type on draft (brute wyverns, elders, etc)

[] Add comments to each monster so you can explain why you love/hate it

[] Add other monster hunter games (create one hate table for each or one table with all monsters from all games.. or both?)

[] Add status to monsters on API so monsters to be release aren't shown

[] Add link to wiki for each monster

[] Drag to somewhere to remove monster and move it back to draft

[] Create weapons type ranking

[] Make rate descriptions customizable

[] Add github link

## Non functional

[x] Change name to rate-my-monsters

[x] Add ids to monsters

[x] Refactor states and drag-n-drop handlers (may need to be refactored again)

[x] Create monster icon component

[] Implement a better way to handle state (?)

[] Use another css solution

[] Add Amplitude to create reports about "Most loved monsters" or "Most hated" etc
